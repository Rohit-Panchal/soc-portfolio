# 🔐 SOC Portfolio – Real-World Security Analysis & Response

Welcome to my personal SOC portfolio capturing major real-world incidents, lessons learned, tabletop exercises and other security operation from my time as a security analyst—built to share my journey and technical growth. This repository documents my work as a Security Analyst over the past 3 years, including:

- 📍 Handling high-severity (P1) security incidents
- 🛡️ Tuning detections and improving response processes in Microsoft Sentinel
- 📚 Contributing to security documentation and knowledge base development
- 🧪 Designing and running tabletop exercises for various threat scenarios

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my hands-on experience, technical depth, and structured approach to cybersecurity challenges. All case studies and scenarios are anonymized to protect client confidentiality.

## 🚀 Why This Portfolio?

In a dynamic threat landscape, technical skills matter—but so does the ability to **communicate clearly, respond under pressure, and build repeatable processes**. This portfolio reflects not only what I’ve done, but how I think through problems and collaborate with teams to improve security posture.
